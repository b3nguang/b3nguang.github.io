## About Me

- I am a college student from Hangzhou, majoring in digital forensics with some development skills.
- I enjoy open source and dislike the tech influencer environment. I like to experiment with new technologies and strongly believe in long-termism.
- I share my technical insights, lifestyle, and thoughts on my [**b3nguang**](https://blog.b3nguang.top/) blog, and publish interesting finds weekly in [**Trend Weekly**](https://weekly.b3nguang.top/).
